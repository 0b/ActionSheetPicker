https://github.com/sickanimations/ActionSheetPicker

Easily present an ActionSheet with a PickerView, allowing user to select from a number of immutible options.
Based on the HTML drop-down alternative found in mobilesafari.

Supported on all iDevices.

Improvements more than welcome - they are kindly requested :)

Thanks to johnnyg, sfilo, and brettg for contributing to the project and making 
ActionSheetPicker better for the iOS developer community.
